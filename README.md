Aloha!

***Hawaiian Goodness*** is a small team dedicated to the perpetuation and revitalization of the Hawaiian Language (*ʻŌlelo Hawaiʻi*). Our software tools are provided for free to make using the language easier and more convenient!

You can visit [our website](https://useduforce.wixsite.com/hawaiiangoodness) to find more resources to learn and practice the Hawaiian language, read about Hawaiʻi's culture and history, look through some traditional recipes and DIYs, and more - and you don't have to live on the islands to do it!

Contact us at [HawaiianGoodnessApau@gmail.com](mailto:hawaiiangoodnessapau@gmail.com) with any questions, feedback, or requests.
